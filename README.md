## Resources
1. (Mozilla)[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events]- Read about the different types of events.

2. (W3Schools)[https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_statements.asp]- Tried to understand the statements, but am still feeling lost. Especially without the recorded Adobe Connect lecture for reference.


## Deductions
I reviewed the list of deductions for this project and in the syllabus.

## Comments
It's still hard for me to follow along with Richard's pre-recorded lectures. Also, watched the lectures but was planning to reference as I worked through the homework and was not able to access them.
